These notes are supplements to STAT-UB 103, an introductory course in probability, statistics, and regression modeling. We use R to teach the course. The first three notes give a pithy introduction to R programming. Feedback is most welcome---please get in touch or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/vaabe/stats103). 

Made in collaboration with [Joshua Loftus](https://joshualoftus.com). Here is the [syllabus](https://github.com/vaabe/stats103/syllabus.pdf). Theme inspired by [Tufte Handout](https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/).
