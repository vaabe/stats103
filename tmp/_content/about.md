These notes are supplements to STAT-UB 103, an introductory course in statistical inference and data modeling. For demonstrations we've used R, a popular language for statistical work---but one among many. The first three chapters are a pithy introduction to the R environment.  

Feedback is most welcome---please get in touch or submit a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/vaabe/stats103">Github</a>.   

More information on the course can be found in the <a href="../addenda/syllabus.pdf" download>syllabus</a>.
