# 2--1 Loading Data

There are many functions in R for loading data: 

* `read.csv()` for csv files (comma separated values) 
* `read.tsv()` for tsv files (tab separated values) 
* `read.xlsx()` for Excel files (from the `readxl` package)
* `read.dta13()` for dat files (from the `readstata13` package)
* `read.table()` for huge datasets

When loading data you must specify the exact file path in the argument (see below). If you don't know how to find your file path, give it a google. Remember to name your dataset (i.e. assign your dataset to an object). 

The following code loads a csv file called 'nyc-airbnb.csv' ^[Download the data <a href="./data/nyc-airbnb.csv" download>here</a>. It has information on every Airbnb listing in New York City, as of August 2019. It was sourced from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/about.html">Inside Airbnb</a>, where you can find Airbnb data for other cities too.] and assigns it to an object called `nycbnb`:

```{r}
nycbnb <- read.csv('./data/nyc-airbnb.csv', header = TRUE)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
nycbnb <- nycbnb %>%
  mutate(price = as.numeric(price), 
         cleaningfee = as.numeric(cleaningfee), 
         availability365 = as.numeric(availability365), 
         sqft = as.numeric(sqft))
```

Note the extra argument, `header = TRUE`, which specifies that the first row of the dataset is a header. If your dataset has no header you should specify `header = FALSE`.^[Here the `=` operator is not used for variable assignment, but rather to specify a parameter for the `read.csv()` function (this is the main difference between the `<-` and `=` operators).]

# 2--2 Viewing Data 

To view the entire dataset, use the `View()` command in the console. A table view of the dataset will open as a new tab. Don't use the `View()` command for large datasets as it is very memory intensive.  

Another way to view your data is to print the first or last few rows using the `head()` or `tail()` function. You can specify exactly how many rows as an additional argument (by default it will print six):  

```{r}
head(nycbnb, n = 5)
```

To check the column names of your dataset, use `colnames()`:

```{r}
colnames(nycbnb)
```

To check the dimensions of your dataset (number of rows and columns), use `dim()`:

```{r}
dim(nycbnb)
```

# 2--3 Basic Data Structures

## Variables and observations

In statistics a **variable** usually refers to some characteristic that is measured. In tabular data the columns often correspond to variables, and the rows correspond to single **observations** or **measurements** of these variables. Data for a variable can be continuous, discrete, or categorical. 

- **Continuous data** can take on infinitely many values (real numbers). E.g. the variable `latitude` in the Airbnb data. 
- **Discrete data** can take on countable values only (integer numbers). E.g. the variable `bedrooms` in the Airbnb data. 
- **Categorical data** fall into a finite number of categories or distinct groups. E.g. the variable `neighborhood` in the Airbnb data.

## Data structures in R

When you load data into R, it is parsed into objects.^[In fact, everything stored in R is an object. Programming in R is known as <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms/">object-oriented</a>.] Every object has a **data type** or **class**, which depends on the kind of values (letters, numbers, etc.) stored in the object. An object's class determines what you can/not do with it--e.g. you cannot perform multiplication between letters and numbers.

Below are the five elementary data types in R: 

* __character__ -- e.g. `'abcd'`
* __integer__ -- integer numbers, e.g. `'2'`
* __numeric__ -- decimal numbers, e.g. `'2.21'` 
* __complex__ -- complex numbers, e.g. `'2+2i'`
* __logical__ -- either `TRUE` or `FALSE`  

Objects can be combined to form larger data structures. Some common ones:  

* __vector__ -- a one-dimensional array; there are two kinds of vectors:
    + __atomic vector__ -- holds data of a single data type
    + __list__ -- holds data of multiple data types
* __matrix__ -- a two-dimensional array; all columns have the same data type
* __data frame__ -- a two-dimensional array; columns may have different data types  

The data frame is a common structure for tabular data. You can check an object's data type using `class()`. 

```{r}
class(nycbnb)
```

To check the data type(s) present in the column `price`:

`r margin_note("Note the extract operator, $\\$$ , which is used to extract a named object from a larger data structure--in this case extract a column from a data frame.")`

```{r}
class(nycbnb$price)
```

The data type(s) in the column `bedrooms`:

```{r}
class(nycbnb$bedrooms)
```

In categorical data, the levels/categories are parsed as **factors** in R:

```{r}
class(nycbnb$borough)
```
